# Visualization of Common Taylor Series 

Complicated functions can be graphed out using **Taylor Series**:

I also made a video that explains more details of how Taylor Series works, please visit: [Taylor, are you serious?](https://youtu.be/OcHCgtH-9ls).
I'd like to think of Taylor Series as "Tailor Series" as it tailors unique power series for different functions.

$$\displaystyle f(x) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!} (x-a)^n$$

__Taylor Polynomial__ is the partial sum of __Taylor Series__.\
This python project shows how more terms of __Taylor Polynomials__ approach the original function using.
